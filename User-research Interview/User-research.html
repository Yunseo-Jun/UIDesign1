      <h1 id="main-title">Name Fortune with My Country</h1>  
      <p class="intro">
        Sometimes... when I really want to leave Korea, I wonder:
        Maybe, from a saju (four pillars) perspective, Korea just doesn’t suit me? Maybe, in terms of geomancy, I'm not meant to live here?
        Maybe... I’m actually supposed to immigrate?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. What’s your relationship like with saju, name fortune telling, feng shui, tarot cards, and other fortune-telling practices?</li>
        <li>2. When you feel tired of Korea, how do you usually cope?</li>
        <li>3. How much time do you typically spend on saju or name fortune readings?</li>
        <li>4. Have you ever seriously thought about immigrating?</li>
        <li>5. Tell me about the last time you tried saju or a name fortune reading.</li>
        <li>6. What do you like about how you currently get your name fortune readings done?</li>
        <li>7. What’s the biggest challenge you face when it comes to name fortune telling?</li>
        <li>8. Why do you keep turning to fortune-telling practices? Why are they important to you?</li>
        <li>9. What types of fortune-telling methods have you tried or seriously believed in?</li>
        <li>10.  Do you believe there might be a “fated place” for you somewhere in the world?</li>
        <li>11. What are you currently doing to make questions like "Should I immigrate?" or "Where is my destiny?" easier to answer?</li>
        <li>12. Have you ever used any other tools or methods to help you work through these kinds of doubts?</li>
        <li>13. What did you like or dislike about those other tools or methods?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="title">JO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1. I tend to believe in them quite a bit—it feels like they suit me well.</li>
        <li>2. I’ve never really hated Korea itself, but I’ve disliked Korean people many times... I do want to work abroad. But then I think, “If I’m not valued as a worker in Korea, would I really be valued abroad?” So I try to improve my skills and worth.</li>
        <li>3. I haven’t done name readings since middle school... As for saju, I look it up on websites every couple of months when I have time.</li>
        <li>4. I’ve thought about it a few times, but realistically, it seems impossible. Still, like I said in #2, if I ever reach a better place in life, maybe I’ll consider it more seriously.</li>
        <li>5. For name readings, I did it with people like celebrities I like or ex-boyfriends. I often check saju because I enjoy exploring myself.</li>
        <li>6. The good part...? It’s just personal satisfaction. Like, “Oh, I seem to match well with this person~” It gives me some psychological comfort.</li>
        <li>7. I'm not sure if I fully understand them, but if it’s not a three-syllable + three-syllable name combo, it feels harder to interpret.</li>
        <li>8. If there’s a cosmic order beyond me, then it makes what I’m going through feel like nothing... and I like that feeling.</li>
        <li>9. I almost fell for a cult once... and I’m actually Buddhist, so I carry a talisman.</li>
        <li>10. Not so much “destiny,” but I do have a few favorite hangouts I feel attached to.</li>
        <li>11. When I went to Japan, I felt a lot of emotions. I’m not sure if I could live there, but I’ve been studying Japanese and I have several Japanese friends. We talk a lot and hang out often. (I guess that counts as effort?)</li>
        <li>12. No...ᅮᅮ</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="title">Choi</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. I sometimes check them for fun when I need a dopamine boost.</li>
        <li>2. I go on a trip.</li>
        <li>3. About 30 minutes every three months or so.</li>
        <li>4. Yes.</li>
        <li>5. Recently, when the new year started, I checked my fortune for the year using a saju app.</li>
        <li>6. It’s fun to get new content coming into my life.</li>
        <li>7. I can't tell if it’s accurate, and I have to wait over time to see if it’s true.</li>
        <li>8. It's fun because it feels like I'm getting a glimpse into my future.</li>
        <li>9. I’ve tried saju and tarot, though I don't 100% believe in them.</li>
        <li>10. I hope I do.</li>
        <li>11. I search for places on map apps and save the places I like.</li>
        <li>12. I use map apps and follow Instagram accounts that recommend places.</li>
        <li>13. Until I actually visit, I can't tell if a place really feels like my own special spot. It's frustrating to only get a sense of the place through a few pictures. Also, sometimes the place feels disappointing after visiting, and it doesn’t really fit me.
